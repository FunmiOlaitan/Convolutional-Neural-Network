# Machine-Learning

Speed limit signs are important for promoting safe driving practices, providing drivers with information about road conditions, and enforcing traffic laws. By indicating the maximum speed at which vehicles should travel on a particular road, these signs can help to reduce the likelihood of accidents caused by excessive speed. 

Machine learning can be utilised to recognize road signs, using computer vision algorithms trained on large datasets of labelled images. These algorithms allow machines to accurately identify different types of road signs, improving road safety and enhancing autonomous driving systems. 

This project will demonstrate how deep learning architecture can be used to identify traffic signs.

The steps include: 
- Collecting and pre-processing a dataset of Road Sign images and No Road Sign images.
- Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Selecting a suitable machine learning model and training it on the training set, using appropriate optimisation techniques.
- Evaluating the performance of the model on the validation set, adjusting hyperparameters as needed to improve accuracy.
- Testing the final model on the testing set to evaluate its performance on new, unseen data.
